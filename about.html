		<p>One thing that I like to know about myself is that I like to have my priorties straight. My number one thing is having a strong relationship with god. My second most important thing is having a good realtionship/spending time with my family and friends. My thrid most important thing is doing the best job that I can in school. This is important to me beacuse if I do good in school then I know that I can go to college and have a good life.I also know that if I don't do well in school then I will not be able to go too college and I will have a hard life. My fourth and last thing that is very important to me is football. Football is important to me because not only do I really love the sport, but it also helps me learn new skills that I can use evry day for an example the concept of teamwork.</p>
